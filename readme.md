# this is a modified version of blobeVM
## how to install
Hit the funny little code button
then hit codespaces at the top
then hit create new on main <br>
then copy and paste this command in your codespace terminal and hit enter.
```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
## OR for more preformance
fork the repo
then go to <a href="https://github.com/codespaces/new">github.com/codespaces/new</a> <br>
then choose the forked repo and 4 core and copy and paste the same command



### I would recommend 4 core, 16 gigs of RAM for the best preformance
